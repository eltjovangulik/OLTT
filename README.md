# Open Latency Tester Theia (OLTT)

## Overview

OLTT (Open Latency Tester Theia) is an innovative, open-source tool inspired by Theia, the Greek goddess of sight, designed to measure input latency in various computing environments. Perfect for both End User Computing (EUC) professionals and gaming enthusiasts, OLTT combines Adafruit QT Py hardware with CircuitPython, providing a DIY approach to latency testing and calibration.

## Hardware Requirements

- Adafruit QT Py
- Luminance sensor
- Additional hardware as per your specific setup requirements

## Software Requirements

- CircuitPython (latest version recommended)
- Necessary CircuitPython libraries

## Getting Started

### Setting Up Your Hardware

1. Assemble the Adafruit QT Py and luminance sensor as per the [Adafruit guide](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4600).
2. Ensure all connections are properly established.

### Installing CircuitPython

1. Download the latest version of CircuitPython from [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/board/qt_py_m0/).
2. Follow the guide to install CircuitPython on your Adafruit QT Py.

### Running the Testing Code

1. Clone or download the OLTT repository.
2. Upload the testing code to your Adafruit QT Py.
3. Detailed usage instructions can be found on [Go-EUC](https://www.go-euc.com/measuring-latency-with-adafruit-qt-py-a-circuitpython-approach/).

### Calibration Code

The calibration code is currently a work in progress. It will allow users to achieve more accurate and tailored measurements.

This is a personal project and is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by my employer, Citrix Systems, Inc. The opinions and contributions are my own and not related to my position at Citrix.

### No Affiliation with NVIDIA

I would also like to clarify that I have no affiliation with NVIDIA Corporation. While Open Latency Tester Theia (OLTT) shares similar goals with tools like NVIDIA's LDAT (Latency Display Analysis Tool) in terms of measuring input latency, it is independently developed with no connection to NVIDIA's product. 

This project aims to contribute to the community by providing an alternative, accessible tool for latency measurement. It should not be considered a replica or a 'ripoff' of NVIDIA's LDAT or any other commercial tool. Instead, it should be viewed as part of the broader ecosystem of tools that enable users to measure and optimize their computing and gaming experiences.
